headline: "We have entered an<br>unprecedented era of<br>innovation in social networks."
headline2: "Innovate freely with<br>production-grade infrastructure that scales to millions of users."

subheadline: "Decentralized social unlocks an entirely new era of apps in which people — not platforms — can control the way social networks work. But transactions at the frequency of messages, posts, and likes overwhelm a blockchain network or business operation expenses before an app reaches mass adoption scale. Frequency is a Polkadot parachain that solves for this gap. It is purpose-built to deliver Web3 social functionality at Web 2.0 scale."
