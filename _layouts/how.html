        <h3>Frequency delivers a new pricing model for building predictable, sustainable businesses.</h3>
        <p>
          Frequency transforms how blockchain transactions are priced and is the first Layer 1 solution that delivers predictable, low cost and 
          high throughput transactions at the scale required to bring decentralized social to millions of users. Instead of paying per transaction, 
          builders reserve an allocation of capacity which is replenished in regular increments. Frequency can be leveraged by Web3 natives, or 
          by Web2.0 businesses that want to tap into new Web3 features and revenue streams.

        <h4>Frequency unlocks an entirely new class of use cases.</h4>
        <p>
            Frequency makes it possible for builders to lock in replenishing capacity instead of managing often high 
            and volatile transaction expenses. This delivers an essential foundation for new business models, and unlocks 
            the use of blockchain technology for an entirely new class of transactions — from social networking and beyond.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Now the technology can be cost efficiently used for a new range of high-frequency, massive-scale decentralized 
            apps and services. This ability-to-scale is not only critical to widespread adoption of Web3, but also for 
            supporting the requirements of traditional businesses seeking to transition to people-centric practices, 
            such as giving users control over their own data.

            <h3>Frequency builds on years of development in decentralized social</h3>
            <p>
                A public social graph completely disconnected from financial incentives is the first essential piece 
                of infrastructure required to unlock the true potential of social networks. The Decentralized Social Networking Protocol 
                (DSNP), in development for nearly three years and with a completed end-to-end proof of concept — makes this possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                DSNP facilitates a secure, open source, universally accessible social graph that is not linked to any financial incentives 
                by crypto tokens or private company database servers. The decoupling of financial incentives from the core protocol makes DSNP 
                distinct from all other blockchain-based social networking projects. This approach is essential to support a healthier 
                third generation of the web. Frequency is the first Layer 1 implementation of this protocol that unlocks compounding network effects.

        <h3>Polkadot's technology uniquely supports this breakthrough</h3>
        <p>
          Polkadot's shared consensus model opens DSNP to scaled growth. As the first production-grade implementation of DSNP, Frequency leverages Polkadot's 
          relay chain to deliver block validation at a fixed price. Future improvements in Frequency will continue to lower cost in the future.
