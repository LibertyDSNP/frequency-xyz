headline: "The web is evolving<br>to prioritize people<br>over platforms"
headline2: "The Social Web"
headline4: "The Social Web places human connection at the forefront, making it possible for people to take control of how their digital world works."
subheadline2: "Today's web made it possible for large companies to extract and pool our collective data as a proprietary corporate asset, used to control nearly every aspect of our digital experience. The Social Web is made up of apps that share the vision that people should control how their digital world works and transparent technology infrastructure that gives people this control." 
subheadline3: "It is being brought into existence by developers connecting apps to shared, community governed, decentralized infrastructure. This technology makes core social networking functionality a basic service  — part of the web itself  — so companies can no longer take data as a corporate asset, people are no longer locked in to the rule of platforms, and we can all enter a new era of people-first apps."
